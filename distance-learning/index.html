                        <p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, education is undergoing a dramatic revolution. Whereby digital platforms, the conspicuous rise of E-learning has been widely considered to be an innovative attempt to facilitate traditional education during the special period. Without a doubt, a vital factor in the prevalence of E-learning is that it breaks through the restriction of time and space. However, I would argue that this new form of education can not achieve similar learning outcomes as attending courses in person. In my opinion, students will suffer from the inefficient learning process and have trouble in seeking opportunities to apply their knowledge.</p>
<p>Firstly, distance education can never work as efficiently as traditional education does in terms of knowledge absorption. In fact, even though the students can click the pause button and replay the video to deepen their understanding of the content of each lecture, they still have difficulty in digesting information. On the one hand, according to an American psychologist, Thorndike, he stated that the fundamental of learning is to exercise the connections between a stimulating situation and a response. Therefore, without interactions with teachers and fellow students, it is difficult for students to draw inspiration from casual conversations with others concerning learning methods. Besides, it is also difficult for teachers to know about their students' learning state and give a helpful suggestion accordingly. On the other hand, plagued by the deficiency of E-learning, caused by the instability of its applications or the restriction of Internet connection, most students and teachers didn't satisfy with the online education experience. For instance, in my experience, I can hardly get clear feedback promptly from my teachers on the Internet. On the contrary, it is convenient for me to communicate with my supervisors at the university, which helps me check my understanding of the topics and expand my knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, distance education can never provide enough opportunities for students to apply their knowledge as traditional education can do. There is no question that the environment can shape us unconsciously. According to Pavlov's dogs study, we can conclude that accumulating background knowledge is very important. For example, a dense academic atmosphere and sufficient resources can improve students' comprehension ability and academic performance. To illustrate, equipped with advanced academic facilities and equipment and collaborated with several state-owned institutions and famous enterprises, traditional education can provide students a plethora of practice opportunities so that students can use their knowledge to accomplish more achievements such as patents and papers. Another case in point, they can also learn the art of dealing with real-life problems and broaden their horizon from their predecessors and colleagues. In contrast, students can only learn theories but hardly gain soft skills through distance learning.</p>
<p>In summary, E-learning can not achieve the same outcome as traditional education does in terms of absorbing, sharing, and using knowledge, although it is commodious and flexible. We should not pursue the new trend blindly, regardless of considering the essence of the study. From my point of view, with the development of science and technology, distance education is likely to be as efficient as traditional education in the future.</p>
