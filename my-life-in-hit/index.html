                        <p><u>Brief Intro</u></p>
<p>My name is Liu Dongqian, an MPhil student from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).</p>
<p>Graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) listed in China 985 and 211 Project in July 2020, I open this blog to record my life and share my thoughts.</p>
<p><u>About My UG Life</u></p>
<p>Majoring in the English with minor in Finance, I not only enhanced my language proficiency, but also improved my business literacy and interdisciplinary capacity. In the final-exam stages, I needed to get prepared for all the exams of two programs within short time. I have to admit that it was a tough process, though. I overcame all the hardships and grew up to be an all-around individual. I have been insisting on continuous attainments in scholastic progression, campus leadership, competition initiatives, patent invention, research projects and internships, just like my perseverance on my Peking Opera playing for over 8 years which also awarded me several honors as well.</p>
<p>To enhance my research skill-sets in the interdisciplinary domain, I laid more emphasis on my research projects. Under the instruction of Prof. Li Baoqiang, I conducted the Chitosan-Based Composite Materials to seek for the new material for feminine hygiene products. Additionally, I performed the English studies on Ecological Discourse Analysis of Xi Jinping's Speeches on Ecological Civilization in which I performed the discourse analysis in combination with linguistics, ecology, philosophy, sociology cognitive science and so forth. Also, in the Research on the valuation of Emerging Technology Enterprises, I applied the Applied Literature Method and Comparative Method, and constructed the P/S Model, EVA Model and DCF to discern out the asset pricing for emerging science and technology companies. I consider such experience as the cultivation of my research skill-sets in different domains.</p>
<p>I once identify myself as a crazy practitioner. I spent most of my spare time in a wide range of campus activities to hone my leadership and enterprising spirits in such a miniature society in university. Taking the role as the minister of Public Relation Department, I led my members to seek for sponsorship from companies like Tencent, Lenovo, Coco Cola, Vanguard, ByteDance , New Oriental, Hujiang School and the like. On balance, I signed up 15 cooperation agreements with accumulating over 200,000 RMB. Through this experience, I not only trained my leadership and business negotiation capacity, but also developed my communication ability with different people through carrying out lectures of experts and celebrities. As the secretariat in Peking Opera Association, I was offered opportunity to perform my opera in some public welfare activities on a regular basis, inspired by the Corporate Social Responsibility Philosophy.</p>
<p>As an active and proactive individual, I opted for digging out my new potentials and self-learning the programming and technology knowledge. Through my unremitting efforts, I cooperated with the postgraduates and PhD students of our university and invented many patents in the domain of robot technology, which endowed me with strong sense of achievement as well. Besides, I have been keen on different entrepreneurship and innovation competitions. My active participation also granted me a myriad of national and international prizes eventually.</p>
<p>In December 2018, I participated in Harbin X-Mind Technology Co., LTD and took charge of 4 main departments as leader of operation department. Over the past few years, I have been an active participant in roadshows, entrepreneurship forums and youth summits held in Beijing, Shenzhen, Suzhou and multiple other cities in China. My duties was to promote our R &amp; D efficiency, so I optimized the management system and communication mechanisms, ensuring the measurable program to meet the requirements in a sustainable way. After we validated the success of our technology by winning the international champion of 110kg combat robot competition held by China Central Television, we incorporated education and integrated into the entertainment robotic competition. We simplified combat robots to be lightweight and modular and combined robot hardware with programing software like SCRATCH. I led and encouraged my marketing team to occupy the market by selling educational combat robots and technical services, successfully hosting science camps for the Chinese Association of Science and Technology and gaining 1.18 million RMB within only 3 months. Such good prospects enabled us to generate 5 million RMB investment term sheets and we had successfully completed our due diligence by one state-owned investment institution.</p>
